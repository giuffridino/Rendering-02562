(1) We know that to calculate the number of photons we need to solve the equation
P * e = N * E, where P is the power in Watts of the light bulb, e is its efficiency,
N is the number of photons we wish to find and E is the energy of one photon.
Already knowing the values for P and e, we can now calculate E by using the formula
E = (c * h)/lambda which is shown in the slides. After calculating this value we solve
for N and find N = 1.26 * 10^19.

(2) Under ideal conditions we assume an efficiency of 100% of the light bulb. We can 
start by calculating the Radiant Flux as phi = 2.4 * 0.7 * 1 = 1.68 J/s.
We then calculate the area of the light bulb by using the formula 4 * pi * r^2
and find that A = 0.001256 m^2. Once we have this we can calculate the Radiant Exitance
as RE = phi / A = 1337 W/m^2. We can also easily calculate the radiant intensity as
RI = phi / omega where omega is the solid angle of the light which in this case,
since it is a sphere, is equal to omega = 4 * pi sr. Solving for RI = 0.134 W / sr.
Finally, to calculate the emitted energy in 5 minutes we simply mulyiply phi
for the number of seconds leading to EmittedEnergy = 504 J. 

(3) Given that the eye is so small we can assume that the angle theta is the same across
the entire eye, meaning that we can simply set cos(theta) = 1 simplyfying our equation.
We can now calculate the Irradiance as Irr = RadiantIntensity * 1/r^2 where r is the distance
of the eye from the light source which we know. Solving the equation leads to 
Irr = 0.134 W / m^2

(4) Similarly to part 3 we assume that either the table is very small, or only one point 
directly orthogonal to the light source such that cos(theta) = 1. We can now calculate the
Irradiance as Irr = (200*0.2)/ (4 * pi * r^2) = 0.796 W/m^2. We can then convert it to 
photometry quite easily by multiplying by 685 and also 0.1 leading to an illuminance of
Ill = 0.796 * 685 * 0.1 = 55 lm/sr.

(5) In this case we can equate the two irradiance functions on each side of the plane
which leads to the equation 40 / 0.35^2 = I_x / 0.65^2 (assuming once again we are performing
the calculation only at one point orthogonal to the light sources). This leads to a value of
I_x = 138 lm/sr. 

(6) In this case we can easily calculate the Radiosity by simplyfying the integral
and solve B = L * pi = 15700 W/m^2. 

(7) In this case it's not as easy as the previous case because we need to change the
integral itself which becomes B = 12000 * pi * integral(cos^2(theta) * sin(theta) * dtheta). 
Once calculated this becomes equal to B = 12560 W/m^2.
